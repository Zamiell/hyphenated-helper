This seems like a very bizarre decision. I was gonna DM you about it but I'd like other people that understand how we do things to pitch in:

The discord has always (since the server lead was passed to you at least) served for members of the "Hyphen-ated Group" to get hanabi games together. It has never been used for generic hanabi usage since the roles are for "Hyphen-ated experience", <#140016142600241152> 's ping is for "Hyphen-ated games" and the people in voice chat have always been people using "Hyphen-ated conventions".

If the renaming happened so people of our group know that those channels are to be used when using our own conventions, I think the "Hat Guessing" and "Other Honventions" channels are enough for that, and calling the channels "Hanabi #" like they were before would suffice to tell everyone it's for "Hyphen-ated usage". If the renaming was so people from outside our group don't get confused about which voice channel to use, that stems from the problem of not properly defining who is supposed to be using this discord in the first place, and renaming the channels is not the solution.

its to clearly delineate the conventions being used in any particular voice channel

> The discord has always (since the server lead was passed to you at least) served for members of the "Hyphen-ated Group" to get hanabi games together. It has never been used for generic hanabi usage since the roles are for "Hyphen-ated experience", <#140016142600241152> 's ping is for "Hyphen-ated games" and the people in voice chat have always been people using "Hyphen-ated conventions".

historically yes.
however, I don't see a good reason why other hanabi players cannot also use this discord server, such as sasha's group (which has been playing here a lot lately and using the voice channels) and ben smalls (who has been playing here a bit lately and using the voice channels)

if your advice is to "let them get their own discord server", well I disagree for a few different reasons, but we probably don't have to get into them right now
Sat Apr 18 02:16:54 UTC 2020 - INFO - main.go:113 - [#speedrun] <RaKXeR#7066> I'll wait to see who's interested
Sat Apr 18 02:19:33 UTC 2020 - INFO - main.go:113 - [#general] <RaKXeR#7066> well, believing this was your viewpoint on the matter is the entire reason I started this conversation now, because I strongly disagree with this. Our group is already pretty large and it should have it's own dedicated area. Making this discord work for all conventions would dilute the voice of our own community and make it harder to get games together
Sat Apr 18 02:21:32 UTC 2020 - INFO - main.go:113 - [#general] <RaKXeR#7066> everyone who knows how to use discord already has a server or group DM of their own to talk with each other, there's no need to use our "Hanabi #" channels. but if you *really* want there to be the option of miscellaneous people being able to review on this discord, I think that'd be best made with a separate voice channel category dedicated to that. Either way, I strongly believe this discord channel should be branded as aimed towards our group, as it already was by its users.
